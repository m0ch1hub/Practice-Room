That's what makes the difference between major and minor.\n\nIf we lower that E by just one half step to [AUDIO:63:1.0:E flat], the interval becomes a [AUDIO:60,63:2.0:minor third] - notice how much darker it sounds?\n\nThe major third is everywhere in music - it's that cheerful jump you hear in \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" or the beginning of \"Kumbaya.\""}]}]}
