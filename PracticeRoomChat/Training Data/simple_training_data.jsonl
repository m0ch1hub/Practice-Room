The simplest way to understand them is to take a major scale and start from different notes.\n\nWhen we play the notes of C major from [MIDI:60@0t-360t,62@360t-360t,64@720t-360t,65@1080t-360t,67@1440t-360t,69@1800t-360t,71@2160t-360t,72@2520t-360t:C to C], that's the Ionian mode - what we commonly call the major scale.\n\nBut if we take these same notes and play from [MIDI:69@0t-360t,71@360t-360t,72@720t-360t,74@1080t-360t,76@1440t-360t,77@1800t-360t,79@2160t-360t,81@2520t-360t:A to A], we get the Aeolian mode - the natural minor scale.\n\nEach mode has its own distinct character. Let's hear a simple [MIDI:60@0t-480t,84@0t-480t,64@480t-480t,79@480t-480t,62@960t-480t,77@960t-480t,60@1440t-480t,76@1440t-480t,59@1920t-480t,74@1920t-480t,57@2400t-480t,72@2400t-480t,53@2880t-480t,74@2880t-480t,55@3360t-480t,72@3360t-480t,43@3840t-480t,71@3840t-480t,48@4320t-480t,72@4320t-480t,43@4800t-480t,36@5280t-480t:minuet:160].\n\nNow let's explore how this same melody transforms through [MIDI:60@0t-480t,84@0t-480t,64@480t-480t,79@480t-480t,62@960t-480t,77@960t-480t,60@1440t-480t,76@1440t-480t,59@1920t-480t,74@1920t-480t,57@2400t-480t,72@2400t-480t,53@2880t-480t,74@2880t-480t,55@3360t-480t,72@3360t-480t,43@3840t-480t,71@3840t-480t,48@4320t-480t,72@4320t-480t,43@4800t-480t,36@5280t-480t,60@5760t-480t,84@5760t-480t,64@6240t-480t,79@6240t-480t,62@6720t-480t,77@6720t-480t,60@7200t-480t,76@7200t-480t,58@7680t-480t,74@7680t-480t,57@8160t-480t,72@8160t-480t,53@8640t-480t,74@8640t-480t,55@9120t-480t,72@9120t-480t,43@9600t-480t,70@9600t-480t,48@10080t-480t,72@10080t-480t,43@10560t-480t,36@11040t-480t,60@11520t-480t,84@11520t-480t,63@12000t-480t,79@12000t-480t,62@12480t-480t,77@12480t-480t,60@12960t-480t,75@12960t-480t,58@13440t-480t,74@13440t-480t,57@13920t-480t,72@13920t-480t,53@14400t-480t,74@14400t-480t,55@14880t-480t,72@14880t-480t,43@15360t-480t,70@15360t-480t,48@15840t-480t,72@15840t-480t,43@16320t-480t,36@16800t-480t,60@17280t-480t,84@17280t-480t,63@17760t-480t,79@17760t-480t,62@18240t-480t,77@18240t-480t,60@18720t-480t,75@18720t-480t,58@19200t-480t,74@19200t-480t,56@19680t-480t,72@19680t-480t,53@20160t-480t,74@20160t-480t,55@20640t-480t,72@20640t-480t,43@21120t-480t,70@21120t-480t,48@21600t-480t,72@21600t-480t,43@22080t-480t,36@22560t-480t,60@23040t-480t,84@23040t-480t,63@23520t-480t,79@23520t-480t,61@24000t-480t,77@24000t-480t,60@24480t-480t,75@24480t-480t,58@24960t-480t,73@24960t-480t,56@25440t-480t,72@25440t-480t,53@25920t-480t,73@25920t-480t,55@26400t-480t,72@26400t-480t,43@26880t-480t,70@26880t-480t,48@27360t-480t,72@27360t-480t,43@27840t-480t,36@28320t-480t,60@28800t-480t,84@28800t-480t,63@29280t-480t,78@29280t-480t,61@29760t-480t,77@29760t-480t,60@30240t-480t,75@30240t-480t,58@30720t-480t,73@30720t-480t,56@31200t-480t,72@31200t-480t,53@31680t-480t,73@31680t-480t,54@32160t-480t,72@32160t-480t,42@32640t-480t,70@32640t-480t,48@33120t-480t,72@33120t-480t,42@33600t-480t,36@34080t-480t,59@34560t-480t,83@34560t-480t,63@35040t-480t,78@35040t-480t,61@35520t-480t,77@35520t-480t,59@36000t-480t,75@36000t-480t,58@36480t-480t,73@36480t-480t,56@36960t-480t,71@36960t-480t,53@37440t-480t,73@37440t-480t,54@37920t-480t,71@37920t-480t,42@38400t-480t,70@38400t-480t,47@38880t-480t,71@38880t-480t,42@39360t-480t,35@39840t-480t:all seven modes:160], each starting on C but using different modes.
