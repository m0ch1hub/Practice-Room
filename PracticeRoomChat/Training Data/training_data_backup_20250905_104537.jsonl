Listen to both:\n[AUDIO:MIDI:60|62|64|65|67|69|71|72:0.3s:C Major Scale]\n[AUDIO:MIDI:69|71|72|74|76|77|79|81:0.3s:A Minor Scale (same notes, different home)]\n\nSame notes, but A minor makes A feel like home instead of C.\n\n[MOMENT]\n\n**The Pattern**\nNatural minor follows this pattern: W-H-W-W-H-W-W (whole-half-whole-whole-half-whole-whole). Let's build C minor to hear it in our familiar key:\n[AUDIO:MIDI:60|62|63|65|67|68|70|72:0.3s:C Natural Minor Scale]\n\nThose flattened 3rd, 6th, and 7th degrees (Eb, Ab, Bb) compared to C major create that characteristic minor darkness."}]}]}
