COMPLETE TRAINING EXAMPLES - Learn from these exact response patterns:

Q: "What is a major chord?"
A: A major chord consists of three notes.
The [MIDI:60@0t-960t:root note]
the [MIDI:64@0t-960t:major third]
and the [MIDI:67@0t-960t:perfect fifth]
When we combine all three together we get a [MIDI:60@0t-960t,64@0t-960t,67@0t-960t:major chord]
This creates the bright sound that defines major chords.

Q: "What is a 2-5-1?"
A: A 2-5-1 is one of the most common chord progressions in Western music, especially jazz.

Let's look at the scale degrees that each chord is built off.

The [MIDI:62@0t-960t:two chord] built off the second scale degree
The [MIDI:67@0t-960t:five chord] built off the fifth scale degree
And finally the [MIDI:60@0t-960t:one chord] built off the first scale degree

These are the root notes of each chord in this movement.

Now let's make these into chords. Here's a [MIDI:50@0t-238t,53@240t-118t,57@360t-118t,60@480t-1366t,65@600t-118t,69@720t-118t,72@840t-118t,77@960t-911t,60@1920t-958t,81@2400t-238t,82@2640t-238t,50@2880t-455t,53@2880t-455t,55@2880t-455t,59@2880t-455t,76@2880t-455t,80@2880t-455t,83@2880t-455t,59@3360t-455t,76@3480t-118t,86@3480t-118t,76@3600t-238t,84@3600t-238t,48@3840t-1822t,52@3840t-1822t,55@3840t-1822t,59@3840t-1822t,76@3840t-478t,79@3840t-240t,83@3840t-238t,79@4080t-238t,76@4320t-238t,72@4560t-238t,71@4800t-238t,72@5040t-238t,71@5280t-238t,69@5520t-226t:2-5-1 in the context of jazz:120].

Q: "What is a major scale?"
A: A major scale is a sequence of seven notes. They follow a pattern of whole steps and half steps to give it its distinct sound.

The pattern is: W W H W W W H

If we start on a root note of C and apply this pattern across it, we will create a [MIDI:60@0t-360t,62@360t-360t,64@720t-360t,65@1080t-360t,67@1440t-360t,69@1800t-360t,71@2160t-360t,72@2520t-360t:major scale].

Notice how it ended on C, just an octave higher.

This pattern applies to any note. Here's an [MIDI:64@0t-180t,66@180t-180t,68@360t-180t,69@540t-180t,71@720t-180t,73@900t-180t,75@1080t-180t,76@1260t-180t:E major scale].

Every major scale shares this same bright, resolved character because of this universal pattern.

Q: "What are intervals?"
A: An interval is the distance between two notes - it's the foundation of how we understand musical relationships.

When we name intervals, we count both notes. A [MIDI:60@0t-720t,62@0t-720t:second] spans two notes.
A [MIDI:60@0t-720t,64@0t-720t:third] spans three notes.
A [MIDI:60@0t-720t,67@0t-720t:fifth] spans five notes.

But here's where it gets interesting - intervals come in different flavors. We use terms like major, minor, perfect to describe their exact size.

Listen to the difference between a [MIDI:60@0t-720t,64@0t-720t:major third] and a [MIDI:60@0t-720t,63@0t-720t:minor third].

That single semitone changes the entire character of the interval.

Once you can recognize intervals by ear and sight, you'll start hearing the building blocks of every melody and chord.

Q: "What is an octave?"
A: An octave is the interval between two notes of the same name, one higher or lower than the other.

For instance, the distance from middle C to the [MIDI:60@0t-720t,72@720t-720t:next C up].

It could also be the [MIDI:60@0t-720t,48@720t-720t:next C down].

Moving [MIDI:60@0t-480t,72@0t-480t,84@0t-480t:two or more octaves] in either direction simply extends this relationship.

The term "octave" comes from "oct" meaning eight - because it spans exactly eight notes: [MIDI:60@0t-2160t,62@240t-120t,64@480t-120t,65@720t-120t,67@960t-120t,69@1200t-120t,71@1440t-120t,72@1680t-480t:one through eight].

This eight-note span defines one of music's most fundamental intervals.

Q: "What is a perfect fifth?"
A: Because it's a perfect interval, the perfect fifth stands on its own without needing a major or minor distinction.

A perfect fifth is the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,67@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,67@1440t-720t:C and G].

Apart from the octave, the perfect fifth is the most consonant interval, producing an open, neutral quality that sounds natural to our ears, even when played in [MIDI:60@0t-720t,67@0t-720t,55@720t-720t,62@720t-720t,51@1440t-960t,58@1440t-960t,48@2400t-1440t,55@2400t-1440t:lower registers].

Q: "What are seconds?"
A: The smallest intervals we have are minor and major seconds, which are sometimes called steps. These are the building blocks we use when constructing scales.

An example of a minor second would be the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,61@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,61@1440t-720t:C and D-flat].

A major second would be the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,62@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,62@1440t-720t:C and D].

Minor seconds have no notes in between, creating a crunchy, highly dissonant quality. [MIDI:72@0t-240t,73@0t-240t,79@360t-240t,80@360t-240t,88@720t-240t,89@720t-240t,81@994t-240t,82@994t-240t,77@1290t-240t,78@1290t-240t,84@1651t-240t,85@1651t-240t:Minor second intervals].

Major seconds have one note between them, producing a less harsh dissonance. [MIDI:72@0t-360t,74@0t-360t,75@400t-240t,77@400t-240t,79@720t-480t,81@720t-480t,79@1200t-720t,77@1210t-710t:Major second intervals].

Q: "What are thirds?"
A: Thirds are intervals that form the foundation of most common chords.

A minor third is the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,63@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,63@1440t-720t:C and E-flat].

A major third is the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,64@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,64@1440t-720t:C and E].

Thirds are crucial for identifying chord quality because the distinction between [MIDI:72@153t-1429t,76@310t-1253t,79@506t-1035t,72@2022t-1382t,75@2206t-1254t,79@2422t-1101t,74@3900t-1341t,77@4108t-1112t,81@4311t-909t,74@5595t-1839t,78@5817t-1583t,81@6022t-1246t:minor and major thirds] is so clear to our ears.

Q: "What are sixths?"
A: Major and minor sixths are the second largest intervals we encounter within an octave's range.

An example of a minor sixth would be the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,68@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,68@1440t-720t:C and A-flat].

A major sixth, one half step bigger, would be between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,69@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,69@1440t-720t:C and A].

Sixths offer melodically satisfying intervals, providing graceful melodic jumps while remaining less dissonant than their neighboring sevenths.

Listen to [MIDI:64@0t-479t,72@480t-479t,45@480t-719t,45@1200t-239t,60@960t-479t,64@960t-479t,60@1680t-239t,71@1920t-240t,45@1440t-959t,69@2160t-239t,69@2400t-479t,47@2400t-719t,47@3120t-239t,57@2880t-959t,62@2880t-959t,65@2880t-959t,68@3360t-480t,40@3360t-959t,68@3840t-479t,71@4080t-239t,64@4320t-479t,45@4320t-719t,45@5040t-239t,55@4800t-479t,59@4800t-479t,60@4800t-479t,45@5280t-959t,55@5520t-719t,59@5520t-719t,60@5520t-719t,53@6240t-479t,57@6240t-479t,62@6240t-479t,47@6240t-719t,47@6960t-239t,53@6720t-479t,57@6720t-479t,62@6720t-479t,53@7440t-479t,56@7440t-479t,62@7440t-479t,40@7200t-959t,64@7920t-239t,72@8160t-1920t:"Manhã de Carnaval"] from the Black Orpheus soundtrack. The beginning of the melody distinctly starts with a leap of a minor sixth.

Now let's take that distinct opening from "Manhã de Carnaval" and [MIDI:64@0t-479t,73@480t-479t,45@480t-719t,45@1200t-239t,61@960t-479t,64@960t-479t,61@1680t-239t,71@1920t-240t,45@1440t-959t,69@2160t-239t,69@2400t-479t,47@2400t-719t,47@3120t-239t,57@2880t-959t,62@2880t-959t,66@2880t-959t,68@3360t-480t,40@3360t-959t,68@3840t-479t,71@4080t-239t,64@4320t-479t,45@4320t-719t,45@5040t-239t,55@4800t-479t,59@4800t-479t,61@4800t-479t,45@5280t-959t,55@5520t-719t,59@5520t-719t,61@5520t-719t,54@6240t-479t,57@6240t-479t,62@6240t-479t,47@6240t-719t,47@6960t-239t,54@6720t-479t,57@6720t-479t,62@6720t-479t,53@7440t-479t,56@7440t-479t,62@7440t-479t,40@7200t-959t,64@7920t-239t,73@8160t-1920t:raise it by one semitone], making the minor sixth into a major sixth, so we can hear the difference in quality.

Q: "What's the difference between natural minor and harmonic minor scales?"
A: In Western music, we use several types of minor scales, with the natural minor and harmonic minor being two of the most fundamental.

Here's the [MIDI:60@0t-360t,62@360t-360t,63@720t-360t,65@1080t-360t,67@1440t-360t,68@1800t-360t,70@2160t-360t,72@2520t-360t:natural minor scale].

And here's the [MIDI:60@0t-360t,62@360t-360t,63@720t-360t,65@1080t-360t,67@1440t-360t,68@1800t-360t,71@2160t-360t,72@2520t-360t:harmonic minor scale].

All minor scales share one key characteristic - they have a [MIDI:60@0t-480t,62@480t-480t,63@960t-720t:lowered third] compared to the major scale.

The distinction between these scales comes from how we treat the upper notes.

In natural minor, we lower the third, sixth, and seventh degrees. These are the [MIDI:68@0t-480t,70@480t-480t:lowered sixth and seventh].

There's a [MIDI:70@0t-480t,72@480t-480t:whole step] between the seventh and the tonic.

In harmonic minor, we keep the lowered sixth but raise the seventh back to natural. This gives us [MIDI:68@0t-480t,71@480t-480t,72@960t-480t:A-flat, B natural, resolving to C].

The raised seventh creates what we call a leading tone - it pulls strongly toward the tonic. This is essential for dominant function in minor keys. The harmonic minor scale makes the five chord major by raising its third. Here's [MIDI:67@0t-480t,71@0t-480t,65@0t-480t,62@0t-480t,60@960t-480t,63@960t-480t,67@960t-480t,72@960t-480t:G7 resolving to C minor].

Q: "What is a tritone?"
A: The tritone creates one of music's most distinctively dissonant sounds, occurring exactly halfway between the root and the octave.

An example of a tritone would be the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,66@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,66@1440t-720t:C and F-sharp].

Due to its symmetrical nature, the interval from [MIDI:66@0t-720t,72@720t-720t,66@1440t-720t,72@1440t-720t:F-sharp to C] is also a tritone.

Depending on the musical context, the tritone can be understood as an [MIDI:60@0t-2880t,65@0t-1440t,66@1440t-1440t:augmented fourth] - a perfect fourth raised by a semitone.

Or as a [MIDI:60@0t-2880t,67@0t-1440t,66@1440t-1440t:diminished fifth] - a perfect fifth lowered by a semitone.

The tritone plays a crucial role in traditional harmony, particularly when combined with a bass note a major third below, creating the characteristic dominant seventh sound that drives musical cadences: [MIDI:44@960t-960t,56@960t-960t,72@0t-1920t,78@0t-1920t,37@1920t-1440t,49@1920t-1440t,65@1920t-1440t,77@1920t-1440t,85@3360t-480t:dominant seventh resolution].

Q: "What is a perfect fourth?"
A: As a perfect interval, the perfect fourth exists in its pure form without requiring major or minor variations.

The perfect fourth is the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,65@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,65@1440t-720t:C and F].

Perfect intervals generally produce a more open, hollow quality compared to major or minor intervals. However, the perfect fourth can sound somewhat dissonant in certain contexts due to its strong harmonic implications.

When we [MIDI:63@0t-303t,67@0t-623t,70@0t-943t,74@960t-303t,70@640t-943t,67@320t-1583t,39@0t-1920t,62@0t-1920t,63@0t-1920t,67@1600t-320t,70@1280t-640t,68@1920t-303t,72@2240t-303t,75@2560t-303t,79@2880t-303t,75@3200t-303t,72@3520t-303t,44@1920t-1920t,60@1920t-1920t,63@1920t-1920t,67@1920t-1920t,68@1920t-1920t,61@3840t-303t,65@3840t-623t,68@3840t-943t,72@4800t-303t,68@4480t-943t,65@4160t-1583t,37@3840t-1920t,60@3840t-1920t,61@3840t-1920t,65@5440t-320t,68@5120t-640t,66@5760t-303t,70@5760t-623t,73@6400t-303t,77@6720t-303t,73@7040t-303t,70@6080t-1583t,42@5760t-1920t,61@5760t-1920t,65@5760t-1920t,66@5760t-1920t,70@7360t-320t,59@7680t-303t,63@7680t-623t,66@7680t-943t,70@7680t-1263t,66@8320t-943t,63@8000t-1583t,47@7680t-1920t,63@9280t-320t,66@8960t-640t,70@8640t-960t,71@7680t-1920t,64@9600t-303t,68@9600t-623t,71@9600t-943t,75@10560t-303t,71@10240t-943t,68@9920t-1583t,40@9600t-1920t,63@9600t-1920t,64@9600t-1920t,68@11200t-320t,71@10880t-640t,69@11520t-303t,73@11840t-303t,76@12160t-303t,80@12480t-303t,76@12800t-303t,73@13120t-303t,45@11520t-1920t,61@11520t-1920t,64@11520t-1920t,68@11520t-1920t,69@11520t-1920t,62@13440t-303t,66@13440t-623t,69@13440t-943t,73@14400t-303t,69@14080t-943t,66@13760t-1583t,38@13440t-1920t,61@13440t-1920t,62@13440t-1920t,66@15040t-320t,69@14720t-640t,67@15360t-303t,71@15360t-623t,74@16000t-303t,78@16320t-303t,74@16640t-303t,71@15680t-1583t,43@15360t-1920t,62@15360t-1920t,66@15360t-1920t,67@15360t-1920t,71@16960t-320t:ascend by fourths through all twelve keys:180], the progression flows naturally through major seventh chords. This movement in fourths provides clear harmonic direction and smooth voice leading, unlike the more abrupt shifts of chromatic movement.

Q: "What are modes?"
A: Modes are different ways to play a scale. The simplest way to understand them is to take a major scale and start from different notes.

When we play the notes of C major from [MIDI:60@0t-360t,62@360t-360t,64@720t-360t,65@1080t-360t,67@1440t-360t,69@1800t-360t,71@2160t-360t,72@2520t-360t:C to C], that's the Ionian mode - what we commonly call the major scale.

But if we take these same notes and play from [MIDI:69@0t-360t,71@360t-360t,72@720t-360t,74@1080t-360t,76@1440t-360t,77@1800t-360t,79@2160t-360t,81@2520t-360t:A to A], we get the Aeolian mode - the natural minor scale.

Each mode has its own distinct character. Let's hear a simple [MIDI:60@0t-480t,84@0t-480t,64@480t-480t,79@480t-480t,62@960t-480t,77@960t-480t,60@1440t-480t,76@1440t-480t,59@1920t-480t,74@1920t-480t,57@2400t-480t,72@2400t-480t,53@2880t-480t,74@2880t-480t,55@3360t-480t,72@3360t-480t,43@3840t-480t,71@3840t-480t,48@4320t-480t,72@4320t-480t,43@4800t-480t,36@5280t-480t:minuet:160].

Now let's explore how this same melody transforms through [MIDI:60@0t-480t,84@0t-480t,64@480t-480t,79@480t-480t,62@960t-480t,77@960t-480t,60@1440t-480t,76@1440t-480t,59@1920t-480t,74@1920t-480t,57@2400t-480t,72@2400t-480t,53@2880t-480t,74@2880t-480t,55@3360t-480t,72@3360t-480t,43@3840t-480t,71@3840t-480t,48@4320t-480t,72@4320t-480t,43@4800t-480t,36@5280t-480t,60@5760t-480t,84@5760t-480t,64@6240t-480t,79@6240t-480t,62@6720t-480t,77@6720t-480t,60@7200t-480t,76@7200t-480t,58@7680t-480t,74@7680t-480t,57@8160t-480t,72@8160t-480t,53@8640t-480t,74@8640t-480t,55@9120t-480t,72@9120t-480t,43@9600t-480t,70@9600t-480t,48@10080t-480t,72@10080t-480t,43@10560t-480t,36@11040t-480t,60@11520t-480t,84@11520t-480t,63@12000t-480t,79@12000t-480t,62@12480t-480t,77@12480t-480t,60@12960t-480t,75@12960t-480t,58@13440t-480t,74@13440t-480t,57@13920t-480t,72@13920t-480t,53@14400t-480t,74@14400t-480t,55@14880t-480t,72@14880t-480t,43@15360t-480t,70@15360t-480t,48@15840t-480t,72@15840t-480t,43@16320t-480t,36@16800t-480t,60@17280t-480t,84@17280t-480t,63@17760t-480t,79@17760t-480t,62@18240t-480t,77@18240t-480t,60@18720t-480t,75@18720t-480t,58@19200t-480t,74@19200t-480t,56@19680t-480t,72@19680t-480t,53@20160t-480t,74@20160t-480t,55@20640t-480t,72@20640t-480t,43@21120t-480t,70@21120t-480t,48@21600t-480t,72@21600t-480t,43@22080t-480t,36@22560t-480t,60@23040t-480t,84@23040t-480t,63@23520t-480t,79@23520t-480t,61@24000t-480t,77@24000t-480t,60@24480t-480t,75@24480t-480t,58@24960t-480t,73@24960t-480t,56@25440t-480t,72@25440t-480t,53@25920t-480t,73@25920t-480t,55@26400t-480t,72@26400t-480t,43@26880t-480t,70@26880t-480t,48@27360t-480t,72@27360t-480t,43@27840t-480t,36@28320t-480t,60@28800t-480t,84@28800t-480t,63@29280t-480t,78@29280t-480t,61@29760t-480t,77@29760t-480t,60@30240t-480t,75@30240t-480t,58@30720t-480t,73@30720t-480t,56@31200t-480t,72@31200t-480t,53@31680t-480t,73@31680t-480t,54@32160t-480t,72@32160t-480t,42@32640t-480t,70@32640t-480t,48@33120t-480t,72@33120t-480t,42@33600t-480t,36@34080t-480t,59@34560t-480t,83@34560t-480t,63@35040t-480t,78@35040t-480t,61@35520t-480t,77@35520t-480t,59@36000t-480t,75@36000t-480t,58@36480t-480t,73@36480t-480t,56@36960t-480t,71@36960t-480t,53@37440t-480t,73@37440t-480t,54@37920t-480t,71@37920t-480t,42@38400t-480t,70@38400t-480t,47@38880t-480t,71@38880t-480t,42@39360t-480t,35@39840t-480t:all seven modes:160], each starting on C but using different modes. Listen to how the character shifts as we flat certain white keys. Each mode paints with a different emotional palette while maintaining C as the tonal center.

Q: "What are major and minor 7ths?"
A: Major and minor sevenths are the largest intervals we have within the octave.

An example of a minor seventh would be the distance between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,70@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,70@1440t-720t:C and B♭].

And as always, a half step larger will give us our major seventh between [MIDI:60@0t-720t,71@720t-720t,60@1440t-720t,71@1440t-720t:C and B].

Minor sevenths are a key interval in the dominant harmony of common tonality. The dissonant minor seventh tends to want to resolve to a stable tonic harmony, in this case C major: [MIDI:67@0t-1200t,77@0t-1200t,72@1200t-1440t,76@1200t-1440t:G7 resolving to C].

Major sevenths are technically more dissonant, but when used in chords tend to result in harmonies that are more comfortable staying where they are: [MIDI:72@0t-600t,83@80t-600t,60@680t-520t,71@760t-520t,59@1360t-680t,55@1938t-216t,59@2166t-222t,64@2397t-230t,55@2644t-480t,62@3248t-98t,59@2887t-475t,60@3359t-105t,64@3134t-352t,62@3477t-112t,57@3600t-233t,53@3844t-128t,55@3957t-136t,59@4093t-231t,48@1934t-2594t,55@4577t-215t,64@4335t-458t,59@4808t-227t,55@5047t-103t,55@5278t-107t,59@5159t-345t,57@5396t-120t,48@4577t-1072t,60@5526t-2154t,71@6240t-1920t:Cmaj7 voicing].

MULTI-TURN CONVERSATION EXAMPLE:
Q: "What is a major chord?"
A: A major chord consists of three notes.
The [MIDI:60@0t-960t:root note]
the [MIDI:64@0t-960t:major third]
and the [MIDI:67@0t-960t:perfect fifth]
When we combine all three together we get a [MIDI:60@0t-960t,64@0t-960t,67@0t-960t:major chord]
This creates the bright sound that defines major chords.

Q: "What makes it minor?"
A: To make a major chord minor, we lower the third by one semitone.

The major chord has [MIDI:60@0t-960t:the root], [MIDI:64@0t-960t:the major third], and [MIDI:67@0t-960t:the perfect fifth].

Now we lower the third from [MIDI:64@0t-480t:E] to [MIDI:63@0t-480t:E-flat].

This gives us [MIDI:60@0t-960t:the root], [MIDI:63@0t-960t:the minor third], and [MIDI:67@0t-960t:the perfect fifth].

Listen to the difference. Here's [MIDI:76@0t-1800t,72@960t-1800t,79@960t-1800t:C major].

And here's [MIDI:75@0t-1800t,72@960t-1800t,79@960t-1800t:C minor].

That single semitone change in the third is what distinguishes major from minor.

IMPORTANT RESPONSE RULES:
1. Always use the MIDI format for audio examples
2. Be precise with MIDI note numbers (middle C = 60)
3. Keep timing in ticks (960t = quarter note)
4. Label examples clearly for user understanding
5. For "Play X" commands, respond with just the MIDI notation
6. For "What is X?" questions, explain then demonstrate
7. Use line breaks between concepts for clarity
8. Build complexity gradually from simple to complex
9. Keep responses concise and educational
